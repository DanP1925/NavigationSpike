# NavigationSpike

## Why this project?

I wanted to compare different navigation libraries to see the advantages and disadvantages of each one.

To test them, I created a project with some screens to test:
- How to define destinations
- How to pass primitive types
- How to pass objects
- How to handle the navigation stack

On the main branch we have screens for each example and on each other branch the implementation with a different navigation library.

The flow of the app is
